					<u>DISPUTE RESOLUTION/ARBITRATION</u>

					<b>
						PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. IT PROVIDES THAT CERTAIN DISPUTES
						MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. IN ARBITRATION YOU GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT,
						INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR
						PROCEEDING. IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY.
						ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AND ARE SUBJECT TO
						VERY LIMITED REVIEW.
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<u>Dispute Resolution/Arbitration</u>. Any Disputes relating to the Website and these Terms of Use
					shall be resolved as follows:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Purpose; Definitions of Disputes. Any Dispute shall be determined exclusively and finally by
						individual arbitration, unless you have exercised your opt-out right pursuant to clause (j) of
						this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration section and except as otherwise specified in such section.
						This Arbitration Provision shall be broadly interpreted. “Dispute” means any claim or
						controversy related to arising from these Terms of Use or use of the Website. The “Parties”
						means you and the Company.
					</li>
					<li>
						Neutral Arbitrator/No Jury. Any Dispute will be submitted to a neutral arbitrator, for a final
						and binding determination, known as an award. The arbitrator is an independent decision maker,
						appointed by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), who reviews and weighs evidence
						provided by all parties, and issues an award enforceable in court. Decisions by an arbitrator
						are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as expressly provided below in this
						Dispute Resolution/Arbitration section, you and the Company waive and relinquish any and all
						rights to have a court or a jury resolve any Dispute. The Parties expressly waive any right to a
						jury trial.
					</li>
					<li>
						Individual Basis/No Class Actions. Any Disputes will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There
						will be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or litigated in any way on a
						class, mass, or other collective basis, and the Parties waive any right to bring or join any
						representative or other claim brought on behalf of the general public, other users, or other
						persons similarly situated. Neither you nor the Company may participate in a private attorney
						general proceeding in court or in arbitration with respect to any Dispute. No Disputes involving
						the Parties may be joined or consolidated with Disputes by or against any other person.
						Notwithstanding any language in this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration provision to the contrary,
						any dispute about the validity or effect of this clause (c) shall be resolved by a court and not
						an arbitrator.
					</li>
					<li>
						Certain Carve-Outs. Despite this arbitration provision, the Parties reserve certain rights to
						proceed in court without waiving their right to arbitrate under this Dispute
						Resolution/Arbitration provision: (i) the Company reserves the right to seek emergency
						injunctive relief from a court to address any circumstances or behavior, by you or any person
						who is using the Website (or obtained information via the Website) in a manner that the Company
						believes may present a risk or threat to the safety, security or reputation of any person,
						location, data system, or other feature or otherwise related to the Website, information of
						Spire Members (as defined in the Spire Loyalty Terms and Conditions); and (ii) you shall have
						the right to file a Dispute in small claims court in your city of residence, as long as the
						matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis; and (iii) No
						provision of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration provision shall limit the right of any Party to
						seek and use any available remedies, judicial or otherwise, for the purpose of collecting upon
						or accelerating any debt involved in any Dispute. Any such collection and/or acceleration
						process shall be governed by applicable law and such procedures may occur outside the
						arbitration process either Party so elects, and such election shall not be deemed a waiver of
						the right to arbitrate any other issue involved in a Dispute.
					</li>
					<li>
						Applicable Rules/Location. This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
						(9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.). The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA under its Consumer
						Arbitration Rules, available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1- 800-778-7879 (the
						“AAA Rules”) except that the Parties expressly agree that the AAA Supplementary Class Rules
						shall not apply, given the express class waiver above, and further agree that Rules 14(a) and 53
						of the Consumer Arbitration Rules shall not authorize any arbitrator or court to find that any
						class, mass, collective or representative claim may be arbitrated. The arbitration shall be held
						in the Palm Beach County, Florida, unless the Parties agree to another location in writing, or
						the arbitrator decides to hold a telephonic hearing to reach a decision based solely on the
						Parties’ submission of documents, or to designate another location reasonably convenient for the
						Parties. In the event of any conflict between the AAA Rules and this Agreement, the provisions
						of this Agreement shall be controlling.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stay of Proceedings. In the event that a Dispute involves both issues that are subject to
						arbitration and issues that are not subject to arbitration, the Parties unequivocally agree that
						any legal proceeding regarding the issues not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending
						resolution of the issues subject to arbitration, except for any proceedings described in clause
						(d) of this section above, which actions shall proceed without a stay.
					</li>
					<li>
						Final and Binding. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties, except for
						any appeal right under the FAA. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any state
						or federal court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent this arbitration provision conflicts
						with any other agreement between the Parties, this arbitration provision shall govern.
					</li>
					<li>
						Payment of Fees. The payment of all fees for registration, filing and administration of the
						arbitration, and the payment of arbitrator fees, shall be governed by the AAA Rules and
						applicable law, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement. The Parties shall bear their own
						legal fees and legal expenses for any arbitration proceeding.
					</li>
					<li>
						Notice and Good Faith Negotiation. Any Party intending to file an arbitration demand against the
						other Party must notify the other Party at least thirty (30) days before filing. The Parties
						agree to attempt to negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution to resolve any such dispute or
						claim during this period. If a Party filing an arbitration demand fails to provide that notice,
						the other Party is entitled to seek a stay of the arbitration proceeding from the AAA for thirty
						(30) days and to participate in settlement negotiations during that period in good faith. Any
						written notice required or desired to be given hereunder shall be deemed given when personally

					<u>Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue</u>
				</Label>
				<p>
					All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising
					therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be
					governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida without
					giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Florida or
					any other jurisdiction).
				</p>
				<p>
					These Terms of Use evidence a transaction or series of transactions, and a relationship, involving
					interstate commerce so as to ensure the applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”).
					Accordingly, this Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the FAA and not state arbitration laws,
					provided that Florida law shall govern to the extent that state law is relevant under the FAA in
					determining the enforceability of this arbitration provision, and otherwise relating to the Website
					and these Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall follow applicable substantive laws, statutes of
					limitations and privilege rules related to any Dispute. The arbitrator shall award the remedies, if
					any, that would be available in an individual court proceeding if arbitration had not been elected.
					Upon the timely request of any Party, the arbitrator shall write a brief explanation of the grounds
					for their decision. In the event of a conflict between applicable state law and the FAA, the FAA
					shall govern. If any portion of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of
					the Agreement shall remain in force.
				</p>
				<p>
					To the extent that a claim or Dispute is not subject to the arbitration provision, the Parties agree
					that any such claim or Dispute, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, shall be
					limited to exclusive personal jurisdiction in the courts of Palm Beach County, Florida. Except as
					prohibited by law, the Parties waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction of such
					courts and to venue in such courts.

					constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

				<p>
					If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
					jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be
