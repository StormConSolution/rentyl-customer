										arising from your enrollment or participation in Spire Loyalty and/or these
										Terms and Conditions. The “Parties” means you and Spire.{' '}
									</li>
									<li>
										Neutral Arbitrator/No Jury. Any Dispute will be submitted to a neutral
										arbitrator, for a final and binding determination, known as an award. The
										arbitrator is an independent decision maker, appointed by the American
										Arbitration Association (“AAA”), who reviews and weighs evidence provided by all
										parties, and issues an award enforceable in court. Decisions by an arbitrator
										are subject to very limited review by a court. Except as expressly provided
										below in this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration section, you and the Company waive
										and relinquish any and all rights to have a court or a jury resolve any Dispute.
										The Parties expressly waive any right to a jury trial.{' '}
									</li>
									<li>
										Individual Basis/No Class Actions. Any Disputes will be arbitrated on an
										individual basis. There will be no right or authority for any Dispute to be
										arbitrated or litigated in any way on a class, mass, or other collective basis,
										and the Parties waive any right to bring or join any representative or other
										claim brought on behalf of the general public, other users, or other persons
										similarly situated. Neither you nor the Company may participate in a private
										attorney general proceeding in court or in arbitration with respect to any
										Dispute. No Disputes involving the Parties may be joined or consolidated with
										Disputes by or against any other person. Notwithstanding any language in this
										Dispute Resolution/Arbitration provision to the contrary, any dispute about the
										validity or effect of this clause (iii) shall be resolved by a court and not an
										arbitrator.
									</li>
									<li>
										Certain Carve-Outs. Despite this arbitration provision, the Parties reserve
										certain rights to proceed in court without waiving their right to arbitrate
										under this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration provision: (a) the Company reserves
										the right to seek emergency injunctive relief from a court to address any
										circumstances or behavior, by you or any person that the Company believes may
										present a risk or threat to the safety, security or reputation of any person,
										location, data system, or other feature or otherwise related to Spire Loyalty,
										the Website or these Terms and Conditions; and (b) you shall have the right to
										file a Dispute in small claims court in your city of residence, as long as the
										matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis;
										and (c) no provision of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration provision shall
										limit the right of any Party to seek and use any available remedies, judicial or
										otherwise, for the purpose of collecting upon or accelerating any debt involved
										in any Dispute. Any such collection and/or acceleration process shall be
										governed by applicable law and such procedures may occur outside the arbitration
										process either Party so elects, and such election shall not be deemed a waiver
										of the right to arbitrate any other issue involved in a Dispute.
									</li>
									<li>
										Applicable Rules/Location. This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal
										Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.). The arbitration shall be administered by
										the AAA under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, available online at www.adr.org or
										by calling the AAA at 1- 800-778-7879 (the “AAA Rules”) except that the Parties
										expressly agree that the AAA Supplementary Class Rules shall not apply, given
										the express class waiver above, and further agree that Rules 14(a) and 53 of the
										Consumer Arbitration Rules shall not authorize any arbitrator or court to find
										that any class, mass, collective or representative claim may be arbitrated. The
										arbitration shall be held in Palm Beach County, Florida, unless the Parties
										agree to another location in writing, or the arbitrator decides to hold a
										telephonic hearing to reach a decision based solely on the Parties’ submission
										of documents, or to designate another location reasonably convenient for the
										Parties. In the event of any conflict between the AAA Rules and this Spire
										Documents, the provisions of this Spire Documents shall be controlling.
									</li>
									<li>
										Stay of Proceedings. In the event that a Dispute involves both issues that are
										subject to arbitration and issues that are not subject to arbitration, the
										Parties unequivocally agree that any legal proceeding regarding the issues not
										subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending resolution of the issues subject
										to arbitration, except for any proceedings described in clause (iv) of this
										section above, which actions shall proceed without a stay.
									</li>
									<li>
										Final and Binding. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the
										Parties, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Judgment on the arbitrator’s
										award may be entered in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction. To
										the extent this arbitration provision conflicts with any other agreement between
										the Parties, this arbitration provision shall govern.
									</li>
									<li>
										Payment of Fees. The payment of all fees for registration, filing and
										administration of the arbitration, and the payment of arbitrator fees, shall be
										governed by the AAA Rules and applicable law, unless otherwise stated in this
										Spire Documents. The Parties shall bear their own legal fees and legal expenses
										for any arbitration proceeding.
									</li>
									<li>
										Notice and Good Faith Negotiation. Any Party intending to file an arbitration
										demand against the other Party must notify the other Party at least thirty (30)
										days before filing. The Parties agree to attempt to negotiate a mutually
										agreeable resolution to resolve any such dispute or claim during this period. If
										a Party filing an arbitration demand fails to provide that notice, the other
										Party is entitled to seek a stay of the arbitration proceeding from the AAA for
										thirty (30) days and to participate in settlement negotiations during that
										period in good faith. Any written notice required or desired to be given
										hereunder shall be deemed given when personally delivered or after three (3)
										days deposit in the U.S. Mail, first class postage prepaid or one (1) day after
										acceptance by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, addressed to
										the address given herein or such subsequent address as is given by proper
										notice.
									</li>
									<li>
										Opt out Right. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION TO APPLY, WITHIN 30
										DAYS OF YOUR FIRST VISIT TO THE WEBSITE YOU MUST SEND A SIGNED LETTER TO THE
										COMPANY AT ONE TOWN CENTER ROAD, SUITE 600, BOCA RATON, FLORIDA 33486 STATING

										provision, the Parties agree that any such claim or Dispute, to the maximum
